    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At Half-Brewed, we're passionate about potions — from the humble Healing Brew to the mysterious Sparkle Surprise™.</p>
    <p>Tucked away between a mossy boulder and a wandering trader, our little stand has been serving adventurers and misfits since the early days of the Overworld.</p>
    <p>We're not a mega-factory. We're not a wizard tower. We're a cozy cauldron in the corner of chaos — and we like it that way.</p>

    <h2>How We Brew</h2>
    <p>All our potions are brewed in small batches using locally-sourced ingredients — from creeper dust to fermented spider eye (we don't judge).</p>
    <p>We mix tradition with experimentation. Some recipes are ancient. Others were discovered by accident during lightning storms. Either way, we believe in the magic of making something weird and wonderful.</p>
